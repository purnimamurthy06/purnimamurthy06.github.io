                <h2>Hi, I'm Poornima...</h2>
                <p>A highly motivated entrepreneur with a passion for creating human centric products and services.</p>
                <p>I am currently running <a href="https://formwaretech.com/" target="_BLANK">FormWareTech</a>, where we build simple but useful digital tools for small businesses. This venture came about as a result of me going to Chile after winning equity free grants from a government sponsored tech acceleration program. I have run a digital services company and also built a lingerie brand in the past.</p> 
                <p>As a passion project, I am in the process of starting a quarterly magazine for the elderly. Watch this space for more details soon.</p>
                <p>For a girl with traditional roots, my start in business was unconventional in every sense of the word. Being an entrepreneur did not mean much to me until the media addressed me as one. Got started with my first business almost by accident when I was still 19 years old. Setting up an office, building a team, negotiating with vendors and talking to customers were all new to me. However, I enjoyed and thrived doing many of those activities. Even though I was always cautious, I started realising that I did not "need to know" business to start one. All I needed was that urge to create something and the passion to keep growing it everyday. Everything else followed.</p>
                <p>I had always wished to be different from others. This desire made me chase unforgettable experiences in life and my life has been full of exciting challenges because of this.</p>
                <p>If you are a woman entrepreneur struggling to get started or just need someone to sound out your ideas with, I would love to help you out. <a href="mailto:purnimamurthy06@gmail.com" target="_BLANK">Let's talk</a>.</p>
