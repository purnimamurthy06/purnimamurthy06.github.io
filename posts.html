                <h2>Thoughts and Musings</h2>
                <p>Here you can find all my published posts. I write about my experiences in the course of building and running my startups. You can also find some poems that I occasionally pen down.</p>
                <p><strong><a href="post/anthyavillada_prayana.html" class="no-decoration">ಅಂತ್ಯವಿಲ್ಲದ ಪ್ರಯಾಣ</a></strong><br>Anthyavillada Prayana in Kannada stands for journey with no End. After my mothers demise I was inconsolable for a period of time. I had to think of expressing my feelings in some way and this was the poem I wrote about my relationship with my mother, especially in the last few months of her life.</p>
                <p><strong><a href="post/hudukidalu_aathma_sangaathi.html" class="no-decoration">ಹುಡುಕಿದಳು ಆತ್ಮ ಸಂಗಾತಿ</a></strong><br>Hudukidalu Aathma Sangaathi in Kannada means woman searching for her soul mate. I dedicate this poem to all women who found their love, the soul mate of their life. Life is not just a series of problems, life does change for good! </p>
                <p><strong><a href="post/saadhakiya_manassu.html" class="no-decoration">ಸಾಧಕಿಯ ಮನಸ್ಸು</a></strong><br>Saadhakiya Manassu in Kannada stands for mindset of a woman achiever. This poem is an attempt at decoding the mindset of women who battle everyday in the hopes of achieving something big one day.</p>
